# MarioNeuralEvolution

An implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to create AI agents to complete the first level of Mario.

The goal of this project was to make a practical demonstration of how a Genetic Algorithm can optimize neural networks. The program allows for user interaction to show how certain variables affect learning.

The program begins by creating 50 random agents

And after some time and iteration, the agents eventually converge to a state where they can complete the level easily.
