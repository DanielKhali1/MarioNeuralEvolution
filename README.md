# MarioNeuralEvolution

An implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to create AI agents to complete the first level of Mario.

The goal of this project was to make a practical demonstration of how a Genetic Algorithm can optimize neural networks. The program allows for user interaction to show how certain variables affect learning.
